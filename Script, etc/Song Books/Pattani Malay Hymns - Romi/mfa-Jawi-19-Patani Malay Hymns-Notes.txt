
Jawi-19-Patani Malay Hymns

This is a booklet of hymns in Patani (aka Jawi, language code mfa) in Roman typescript.

The booklet consists of:

1. Editorial information.

2. Hymns 1-79.

3. Hymns 80-95 in the manner of a supplement, which is bound in, but on poorer paper and poorer quality typescript.

4. Indexes.

It is difficult to reproduce hymns 80-95 legibly when scanned in black and white, but these pages are somewhat clearer when scanned as grayscale pages.

Therefore, two files have been produced:

1. mfa-Jawi-19-Patani Malay Hymns.pdf

	This black and white file is small in size, but hymns 80-95 are very poor.


2. mfa-Jawi-19-Patani Malay Hymns-ver2(hymns 80-95 in grayscale).pdf

	This file is about twelve times larger than '1', but hymns 80-95 are produced in grayscale form and are just about readable.
